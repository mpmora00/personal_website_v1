# Personal Website
In 2020, I initiated this website as a means to self-educate in HTML and Web Development, resulting in its current state, which may not meet professional standards but met my goal back then. 

**However, as of April 2024, with the progression of my skills and professional experience in full-stack development, I am currently upgrading this site to React.**

## Purpose
I wanted to work on this website as a persona project to showcase both my art and some of my coding samples.
